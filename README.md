## What is Version Control?

**Definition:** Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

**Key Concepts:**
- Repository: A storage location for a project's files and version history.
- Commit: A snapshot of the project at a specific point in time.
- Branch: A separate line of development within a repository.
- Merge: Combining changes from different branches.

## Why Version Control?
- Collaboration:
    - Enables multiple people to work on a project simultaneously.
    - Facilitates collaboration by managing and merging changes.
- History Tracking:
    - Maintains a detailed history of changes made to the project.
    - Each commit provides a snapshot of the project's state.
- Revert to Previous States:
    - Allows reverting to a previous version of the project if needed.
    - Provides a safety net against errors or unwanted changes.
- Parallel Development:
    - Supports the creation of branches for parallel development of features or bug fixes.
